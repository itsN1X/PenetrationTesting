WIRESHARK:
---------
In interface list choose options
1.uncheck all name resolution except mac resolution
2.We can use multiple NIC's
3.Tshark is CLI for Wireshark
4.Computer has only one default gateway
5.Allow promiscuous mode on all interfaces
6.In display options tick all 

In wireshark goto statistics --> endpoints 
In wireshark goto voice-over-ip calls 
In wireshark goto statistics --> flow graph

You can save the capture before or after capturing

Multiple NIC CAPTURE:
--------------------
ping 8.8.8.8 will use one adapter
ping 10.0.0.1 will use another adapter
In interface list choose both the interfaces to capture

TSHARK:
------
first locate tshark in program files and add it to the windows path
In cmd
-tshark
This captures tshark on one interface
-tshark -D
List all interfaces
-tshark -i 1
Capture on 1 interface
-tshark -i 1 tshark_output.pcap -F pcapng
Save the o/p in pcap file and analyse this file in wireshark

Wireshark works in linux and mac much better
and in linux and mac we can use tcpdump

Go to terminal and 
$ tcpdump -D
To know interfaces
$ tcpdump -i 3
Capture on interface 3
$ tcpdump -i 3 -w output.pcap
Output to a file and analyse in wireshark


ARP and PING:
------------
ARP -address resolution protocol
and its job is to what find layer 2 mac address  to send the packet to
Arp message is sent to switch and it is being forwarded to everyone within the network and correct device with destination mac responds back to the sender.
ARP can resolve ip to mac in same n/w.


If the message we want to send is off the n/w it will be sent to the router and it will go to destination.

	Ip to Mac Resolution Rules:
	--------------------------
	Destination ip address is compared with routing table.
	and examine ARP CACHE on local device
	if cache is not there send out broadcast arp request

	ICMP/PING:
	---------
	Message type popular one are
		0 - Echo reply
		8 - Echo
		3 - Destination unreachable

	To verify arp cache use command arp -a in terminal and examine the dynamic entries
	If we want to clear arp cache use command arp -d* with admin rights

	In terminal $route PRINT to see route table
